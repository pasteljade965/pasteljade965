- 👋 Hi, call me Jade
- 👀 I’m interested in design, data analysis, and things of the sort. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning R, SQL, and how to use Figma and all of its capabilities. I have big dreams but not enough technical skills to back them up yet fml 😭
- 💞️ I’m not looking to colaborate, as I am still a beginner-- but I'll help with what I can!
